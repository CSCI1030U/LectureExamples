Observations:

- The rej state has no exits and is not an accept state.  This is used for rejected strings.
- The string must start with an 'x', since any other character sends us to the rej state
- There can be more 'x's after the first 'x', but 1 is the minimum
- There must be a 'y'
- There can be more 'y's after the first 'y', but 1 is the minimum
- There must be an 'x'
- This last 'x' must be the last character, as any more characters send us to the rej state
- Any characters other than 'x' or 'y' automatically move us to the rej state

Summary:

This FSA recognizes one or more 'x's, then one or more 'y's, and then a single 'x'

Equivalent regular expression (regex):  x+y+x
